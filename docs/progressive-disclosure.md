# Progressive disclosure model

This plugin separates two related mechanisms that are often conflated:

- Agent Skills progressively load instructions and resources.
- Tool discovery progressively loads callable schemas.

DeepSeek Harness already owns the first mechanism. This plugin supplies a
cache-stable fallback for the second where the provider protocol has no native
deferred-tool content blocks.

## Skills layers

The open Agent Skills format defines three disclosure levels:

| Level | Session-visible material | Load boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata | `name` and `description` | Skill catalog publication |
| Instructions | Complete `SKILL.md` body | `skill` activation |
| Resources | Referenced scripts, files, and assets | Explicit need |

DSH's Skills subsystem already publishes a compact name/description catalog,
loads the complete body through the `skill` tool, and resolves resources only
when needed. The plugin does not duplicate or replace that subsystem.

## Tool layers

Stable proxy mode implements an analogous three-level tool path:

| Level | Session-visible material | Load boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery entry | `tool_search`, `tool_dispatch`, common direct tools | First request |
| Exact definitions | Matching names, descriptions, and parameter schemas | `tool_search` result |
| Execution | Original tool body and result | `tool_dispatch` nested call |

The complete catalog and real executors stay in process memory. Only exact
matches enter conversation history.

## Native deferred tools versus stable proxy

A provider-native deferred-tool protocol can receive all definitions out of
band, initially render only non-deferred tools, and later return typed tool
references without changing its cache prefix. DSH's current generic
`ToolSchema` contains only `name`, `description`, and `parameters`; the DeepSeek
Chat Completions tool protocol also has no equivalent deferred-reference block.

Stable proxy therefore keeps two generic schemas fixed and performs real-tool
validation at dispatch time. This preserves prefix stability and ordinary DSH
policy, with two explicit trade-offs:

- the outer request has no provider-native grammar for a deferred tool;
- discovery and execution are separate calls.

When DSH adds provider capability negotiation and native deferred references,
a future native mode can use those features without changing the stable proxy
fallback.

## Cache contract

The stable request prefix is:

```text
fixed tool schemas → fixed system sections → append-only message history
```

Discovery adds one tool result after the reusable prefix. It does not change
the fixed schemas or the generated Code Mode SDK. This is the central
difference from `dynamic` mode, whose native family activation intentionally
changes the request header.
